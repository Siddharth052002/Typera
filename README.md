## Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Dynamic Paragraph Generation:** Implementing the feature to dynamically generate random paragraphs for users to type was challenging. Solution: Used JavaScript to randomly select paragraphs from a predefined list.

- **Real-time Tracking:** Tracking user input, calculating WPM and CPM, and updating the interface in real time required careful synchronization. Solution: Used event listeners and interval functions to ensure accurate tracking and updating.

- **Theme Switching:** Enabling users to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly was complex. Solution: Used CSS classes and JavaScript to apply theme-specific styles.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts:** Implement user accounts to track progress and enable users to compete with friends.

- **Customizable Time Limits:** Allow users to adjust the time limit based on their skill level.

- **Multi-Paragraph Typing:** Introduce multi-paragraph typing exercises for a greater challenge.

- **Leaderboard:** Create a global or friend-based leaderboard to encourage healthy competition.
